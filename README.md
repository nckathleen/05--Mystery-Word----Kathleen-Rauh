# Mystery Word

## Description:

Welcome to the game of Mystery Word, where you have 8 chances to guess the letters in a secret word.

## How To Run Mystery Word:

From the command line, type>>>  
**python3 mystery_word.py**

You will be asked to select a difficulty level of **(E)**asy, **(M)**edium, or **(H)**ard.  You will also have the option to **(Q)**uit if the mystery seems too scary.

Once you have chosen the difficulty level for the game, the computer will randomly generate an appropriate word and you will be prompted for your first letter guess.

Throughout the game, you will be able to see all your previous guesses and also your progress in the word you are guessing.

You will be prompted to make guesses until you either:
+ correctly guess the word, or
+  make 8 incorrect guesses, thus running out of chances to guess.

Whether you win or lose, you will see the whole mystery word and of course, you will **always** have the option to play again.

## **_GOOD LUCK!!_**
